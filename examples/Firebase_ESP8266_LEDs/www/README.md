# Firebase Neopixel Web demo #

This demo console shows you how to synchronize data from the web to a device.

## Installation ##
The demo uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) and
[Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) to simplify the UI and dependencies
of the project.

For Bower, you need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). After node is
installed, install the Bower package by calling:

`npm install -g bower`

After Bower is installed, you are ready to update the project dependencies with
Bower by running:

`bower install`

With the dependencies set, serve the www folder from a web server. For example,
you can use the Python Simple HTTP server module by running:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]`

With the web server running, navigate to /web-demo.html and you should see
the demo load.
